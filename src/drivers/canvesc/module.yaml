            description:
                short: Configure Canvesc bus speed
                long: |
                    This enables/disables standard can bus frames for controlling VESCs and servos. The different modes define different
                    speeds, for example Canvesc250 = 250kb/s. Not all ESCs devices support all speeds.

                    Note: this enables Canvesc on the can bus.
            type: enum
            values:
                0: Disable
                250: Canvesc250
                500: Canvesc500
                1000: Canvesc1000
            reboot_required: true
            default: 1000
        CANVESC_MIN:
            description:
                short: Minimum RPM speed for VESC
                long: |
                    Minimum speed in eRPM for VESC in percent when vehicle is armed. The value depends on the VESC. Make
                    sure to set this high enough so that the motors are always spinning while armed.

        CANVESC_PP:
            description:
                short: Number of magnetic poles pairs of the motors.
                long: |
                    Specify the number of magnetic pole pairs of the motors.
                    It is required to compute the RPM value from the eRPM returned from VESC.

                    Either get the number from the motor spec sheet or count the magnets on the bell of the motor (not the stator magnets) and divide by 2.
                    Typical motors for 5 inch props have 14 poles and 7 pole pairs.

        CANVESC_MOT_RATE:
            description:
                short: Rate for sending commands to motors in Hz
                long: |
                    Specify the update rate for motors
            type: int32
            default: 7
