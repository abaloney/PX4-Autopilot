                    This enables/disables VESC control over the can bus. The different modes define different
                    speeds, for example Canvesc50 = 50kb/s. Not all ESCs support all modes.

                    Note: this enables Canvesc on the can bus.

            description:
                short: Minimum Canvesc Motor Output
                long: |
                    Minimum Output Value for Canvesc in percent. The value depends on the ESC. Make
                    sure to set this high enough so that the motors are always spinning while
                    armed.

        CANVESC_POLES: # only used by dshot so far, so keep it under the dshot group
            description:
                short: Number of magnetic poles of the motors
                long: |
                    Specify the number of magnetic poles of the motors.
                    It is required to compute the RPM value from the eRPM returned with the ESC telemetry.

                    Either get the number from the motor spec sheet or count the magnets on the bell of the motor (not the stator magnets).
                    Typical motors for 5 inch props have 14 poles.
